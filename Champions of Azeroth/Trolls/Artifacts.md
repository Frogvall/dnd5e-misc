### Chapter 4: Artifacts

#### Ancestral Staff

*Weapon (quarterstaff), uncommon (requires attunement by a Priest with the Witch Doctor specialization)*

An Ancestral Staff is an intricate staff with names of generations of witch doctors carved into it. The wielder can call upon them for wisdom and guidance in times of peril.

As an action, you can raise the staff and ask one question aloud. After 1 minute, the answer appears written on the head of the staff in a language of your choice. The answer is provided by the witch doctors that held the staff before you and to the best of their knowledge. You can use this property once and regain the ability to do so again at dawn.

#### Ancient Amani Longbow

*Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. In addition, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and you ignore half-cover and three-quarters cover when attacking with this magic weapon.

#### Jang'thraze the Protector

*Weapon (scimitar), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.

When you damage a creature with this sword, you gain temporary hit points equal to roll of the attack die.

In addition, if you're also attuned to Sang'thraze the Deflector, you can use a bonus action to merge both swords into Sul'thraze the Lasher. You are automatically attuned to it.

#### Jin'rohk, the Great Apocalypse

*Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. In addition, while you hold the sword, you can use your reaction to make one melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals damage to you. You have advantage on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any damage immunity or resistance the target has.

#### Prestige of the Amani

*Weapon (warclaww), very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster with at least one spell that deals lightning damage)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.

This warclaw has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a creature using this warclaw, you can expend 1 charge to cast a non-cantrip spell that deals lightning damage, as a bonus action. The spell is cast as if you were using a spell slot two levels higher than the spell slot you expend.

#### Rush'kah Mask

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a Hunter with the Shadow Hunter specialization)*

This wooden, carved mask, typically the size of a small shield, is a focus that many shadow hunters use. These masks provide protection from evil spirits and those seeking to harm the wearer.

You can see invisible creatures and other creatures cannot hide from you. You have advantage on saving throws forced upon you by undead or aberrant creatures.

#### Sang'thraze the Deflector

*Weapon (scimitar), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.

When you are hit by an attack, but before damage is rolled, you can use your reaction to increase your AC by 2 for the attack. This might turn a hit into a miss.

In addition, if you're also attuned to Jang'thraze the Protector, you can use a bonus action to merge both swords into Sul'thraze the Lasher. You are automatically attuned to it.
