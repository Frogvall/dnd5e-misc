# Introduction

Warcraft is one of the most successful and popular fantasy video game franchises of all time. Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition is one of the most successful and popular fantasy taletop role-playing games of all time. Frankly, it's a crime that there's not an official collaboration between them! In light of this glaring absence, various creators have embarked on their own homebrew projects to bring the world of Azeroth to 5E, where as my favourite is *Champions of Azeroth* by Silverblade. The scope of the Champion series is limited however, and for us who wants to play trolls of all kind, only the Jungle Trolls and the Ice Trolls (as Frostborn Trolls in Champions of Northrend) are represented. This modules is an extension of the Champions series which brings more player options for playing Trolls.

### Design Principles

The design principles for *Champions of Azeroth* are:

- Start with D&D 5E, change things only when necessary, and add on everything else needed for a Warcraft adaptation. In practice, this generally means starting with a 5E class, add some extra Warcraft flavor and/or utility features, and write new Warcraft subclasses.
- Keep it simple. There is a tremendous amount of content in Warcraft, and you could go mad trying to do a totally faithful implementation of any Warcraft class. I tried to pick simple core fantasies and mechanics to build around, even if that means leaving a lot of inspiration unused.
- Stick to 5E design principles and mechanics. 5E does things certain ways (e.g., favoring advantage over static roll bonuses), and by now has done a lot of things in a lot of different ways. Use those principles and mechanics whenever possible, and don't go against them.
- Make sure that things using 5E vocabulary are unchanged, and things named similarly should be recognizable. Warlocks should have the same core design as 5E warlocks, mages should be based on wizards, *barkskin* is still the same terrible spell, etc. There are inevitably going to be exceptions, but they should be few and far between.
- Don't neglect utility or roleplay. Given the *Warcraft* inspiration, it can be tempting to just focus on cool combat features. But part of the joy of a 5E adaptation is getting to interact with Azeroth outside of video game fighting. I want to make sure that the design engages with the full 5E experience, not just combat.

I completely agree to the design principles of the Champions series and have done my best to adhere to them.

### On Balance

Since I am mostly dealing with subraces and subclasses, I am aiming for internal balance between the already existing ones and those I add. Hence I can approach this using a limited balancing scope and have no intention to benchmark these against vanilla dungeons and dragons.

<div style='margin-top:390px;'></div>

### What This Is

*Champions of Azeroth* provides a plethora of new content to play 5E in Azeroth (or its various associated planes, worlds, and so on). It provides completely new *Warcraft*-inspired races and classes, as well as new equipment, feats, spells, and more. This work is meant to be an addition to the Champion series, adding player options for playing trolls or troll focused campaigns.

### Contact and Feedback

I welcome any and all feedback on any of my work. You can reach me (Auvreannia) via the the [Champions of Azeroth Discord](https://discord.gg/cRhWBfHW).

### Acknowledgements

# Chapter 1: Subraces

[Champions of Azeroth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iEgdrwyGwAA7b7TW353_CzjhoQP-gYAF/view) introduced the troll race and one subrace, the jungle trolls. In addition, [Champions of Northrend](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltdlu9oR0giZHfzMLUYWVfxq79tB7StI/view) introduced the generic *frostborn* subrace, that can be used for creating ice trolls. I have included all of the above in this module for easy access, with permission from Silverblade, in addition to adding three new subraces; the forest trolls, the sand trolls and the Zandalari.

### Troll

Once at home in the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale, the fierce trolls of the Darkspear tribe were pushed out by warring factions. Eventually the trolls befriended the orcish Horde, and Thrall, the orcs' young warchief, convinced the trolls to travel with him to Kalimdor. Though they cling to their shadowy heritage, the Darkspear trolls hold a place of honor in the Horde. Trolls are cunning, ruthless, and savage, eager to defend themselves and their allies---by any means necessary.

Most ice trolls are cannibalistic and tend to eat their fallen enemies raw, believing that they consume the souls of their victim and gain their strength. Like other trolls the ice trolls are superstitious, religious and practice voodoo.

Their spirit powers can both heal and curse, walking the line of dark and light in hope of saving the future of trollkind, doing whatever it takes to secure a future for their kin.

### Witch Doctor

*Priest specialization, requires Troll or Orc*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Witch doctors are spellcasters and alchemists. These dastardly magic users are adept at manipulating the chemical processes within their fellow warriors in order to augment their combat abilities. They served as spellcasters for the Horde during the Third War, being able to create several types of wards for such activities as healing, trapping, and watching over the land.

#### Witch Doctor Specialization Spells

| Priest Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*augury*, *enlarge/reduce* |
| 5th | &ensp;*haste*, *speak with dead* |
| 7th | &ensp;*death ward*, *shadow of moil*<sup>XGtE</sup> |
| 9th | &ensp;*commune*, *dream* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

<sup>XGtE</sup> *Spell found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything*.

#### Master of Juju

When you choose this specialization at 2nd level, you learn how to magically brew your spells into special concoctions. You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. In addition, when you finish a long and have your alchemist's supplies available, you can create a concoction containing the power of one of your spells. When creating a concoction, you select one spell you know from the transmutation school (you don't need to have it prepared) and store it into a bottle. If the spell requires the caster to choose its application when casting, like with for example *enlarge/reduce*, you makes this choice when you create the concoction. The concoction go bad at the end of your next long rest or after 24 hours, whichever comes first, at which point it is rendered useless and harmless. When reaching 6th level you can create up to two concoctions and at 14th level you can create up to three concoctions. The concoctions you create can not have their combined spell level surpass your proficiency bonus.

You can also create a concoction by spending 10 minutes and paying Faith Points as if you were creating a spell slot of the same spell level as the spell stored in the concoction.

A creature can use an action to consume a concoction, and it is considered the target of the spell. If a save is required, it is made versus your spell save DC. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate.

#### Ask da Spirits

Also at 2nd level, you learn how to glean knowledge from surrounding spirits. You gain proficiency in the Religion skill, and when making an Intelligence ability check, you can instead make a Charisma (Religion) ability check. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Master of Voodoo

At 6th level, you learn to create a voodoo doll that can be linked to the soul of a creature. As long as you have material available; grass, sticks, or similar, you can create a doll as part of a short or long rest. The doll can be used as a spell casting focus. In addition, as a bonus action you can try to link the doll to a creature you can see within 60 ft. The creature need to succeed on a intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 necrotic damage and become linked to your voodoo doll. While linked you can spend a bonus action to pinch the doll; the target repeats the saving throw taking 1d6 necrotic damage on a failure. Both damage rolls are increased to 2d6 at 14th level. The link breaks after 10 minutes, when you die, become unconscious, or when you link it to another creature. It also breaks if the target is no longer on the same plane of existence.

The linked creature knows that something is wrong as soon as it gets linked. It can use an action to make a Wisdom (Insight) check versus your spell save DC to figure out who is causing it pain.

\columnbreak

#### Darkest Mojo

When you reach 14th level, your control over the soul linked to your voodoo doll strengthens. When you use a Shadow Word on a creature, other than the creature linked to your voodoo doll, you can also apply the effects of the Shadow Word on the linked creature for free.

#### Master of Wards

Starting at 18th level, you can construct a powerful ward to protect yourself and your allies. You summon a totemic representation of your favored loa within 30 ft of you. It is ethereal, cannot be destroyed and gives the following benefits for one minute:

- ***Sentry.*** While within 30 ft. of the ward, you and any friendly creature can see invisible creatures and other creatures cannot hide from them. Attacks made ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
- ***Stasis.*** You can use your reaction whenever a hostile creature moves within 30 ft. of the ward, or starts its turn there. The creature have to make a Constitution saving throw versus your spell save DC or get stunned until the start of their next turn.
- ***Healing.*** You and any friendly creature that starts its turn within 30 ft. of the ward regains 3d6 hit points.

<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Chapter 3: Blessings of the Loa

Blessings are supernatural gifts granted by deities. Most trolls are superstitious and worship loa---wild gods or spirits of the land. Countless loa exist, most weak, but some very powerful. Most are shapeless, whereas others have animal or creature forms. Many of the loa make their home in the Garden of the Loa in Zuldazar, or across Zandalar more generally, with major temples found in traditional troll lands. This chapter is here to give the GM ideas on blessing the more powerful loas could hand out to their champions. For more information on blessings, refer to the Dungeon Master's Guide, chapter 7.
