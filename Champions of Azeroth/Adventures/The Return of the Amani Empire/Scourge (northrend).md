>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The lich has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Undead Nature.*** The lich doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep. Magic can't put the lich to sleep.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.
>
> ***Frost Nova (Recharge 5-6).*** The lich points its finger at a creature within 120 ft. The target and each creature within 30 ft. of it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (4d12) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any target that misses fails the saving throw by at least 5, takes double damage. In addition, any creature that fails its save suffer from the following effects for one minute: it has its speed halved, takes -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and can't use reactions. On its turn, it can take either an action or a bonus acton, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effects on a successful save.
>
> ***Ice Lance.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +11 to hit, reach 120 ft., one target. Hit: 33 (6d10) cold damage. If the target is
on the ground or adjacent to a wall, or a similar large or larger, immobile object, it is pinned to that surface and restrained
until the end of the lich's next turn. A pinned creature can end this effect early by using its action to make a successful DC 18 Strength check.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The lich casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 19):
>
> At will: *detect magic, mage hand, prestigitation, misty step*
> <br>3/day each: *animate dead, counterspell, dispel magic, invisibility, mirror image*
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Dark Ritual.*** One friendly undead creature within 90 ft. of the lich dies. The lich regains hit points equal to half the amount of hit points the creature had remaining and it can roll to recharge *frost nova*.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Frost Armor.*** When the lich or one undead unit within 90 ft. of the lich is hit by an attack, the target increases its AC by 5 until the start if the lich's next turn. In addition, the attacker takes 7 (2d6) cold damage.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time only at the end of another creature's turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> ***Death and Decay (Costs 2 Actions)*** The lich casts *Death and Decay*.
>
> ***Dark Ritual.*** The lich uses *Dark Ritual*.
>
> ***Teleport.*** The lich casts *Misty Step*.
