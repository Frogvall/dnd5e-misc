> ***Elven Cunning.*** The banshee have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to resist the effects of enchantment and illusion magic.
>
> ***Undead Nature.*** The banshee doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep. Magic can't put the banshee to sleep.
>
> ### Actions 
> ***Curse.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit 25 (6d6 + 4) necrotic damage and the target is poisoned until the start of the banshee's next turn.
>
> ***Etherealness.*** The banshee enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
>
> ***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid that the banshee can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, both the banshee and the target are stunned until the end of the banshee's next turn and the banshee loses all damage resistances and is vulnerable to force, psychic, radiant and bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from magical attacks while stunned by this power. On a failed save the target is possessed by the banshee; the banshee then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The banshee now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The banshee can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
>
> The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the banshee ends it as a bonus action, or the banshee is turned or forced out by an effect like the *dispel evil and good* spell. When the possession ends, the banshee reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this banshee's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Anti-magic shell*** When a creature within 30 ft. becomes the target of a spell, the banshee can surround it with a field of necrotic energy that repels harmful magic. Until the beginning of the banshee's next turn, the target has advantage on saving throws against spells, and resistance to the damage from spells.
