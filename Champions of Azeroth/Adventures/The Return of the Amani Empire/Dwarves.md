> ***Bash.*** The first time the mountain king hits with a Warhammer attack in a turn, the attack deals an extra 14 (4d6) lightning damage and the target must succeed with a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the start of the mountain king's next turn.
>
> ***Earthen Ancestry.*** The mountain king has advantage on saving throws against transmutation magic, as well as spells or effects that would alter its form.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The mountain king makes two Warhammer attacks.
>
> ***Warhammer.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60/120 ft., one target. Hit: 9 1d8+5 bludgeoning damage. On a ranged attack, the hammer magically reappears in the mountain king's hand after the attack.
>
> ***Thunder Clap (Recharge 5-6).*** The mountain king slams the ground with its warhammer. Any creature of its choice within 20 ft. of the mountain king must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (4d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that fails its save has its speed halved, takes -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and can't use reactions. On its turn, it can take either an action or a bonus acton, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Avatar (1/Day).*** When the mountain king takes damage that would bring it to 0 hit points, it instead regains 30 hit points. In addtion it increases its armor class by 5 and becomes immune to the damage and effect of spells. This effect lasts until the mountain king takes damage.
>
> ***Stoneform (1/Day).*** When the mountain king takes damage, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage until the beginning of its next turn.
