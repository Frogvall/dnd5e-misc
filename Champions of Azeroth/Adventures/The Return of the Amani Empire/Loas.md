> ***Beak.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
>
> ***Call Lightning.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 120 ft. Hit: 14 (4d6) lightning damage, and the creature can't take reactions until the start of Akil'zon's next turn.
>
> ***Electric Storm (1/day).*** One creature within 120 ft. becomes petrified and is lifted 30 ft. straight into the air for 1 minute. At the start of each of the petrified creature's turns, it casts *call lightning* at any creature within 120 ft., that touches the ground, unless that creature is within 5 ft. of the point straight under the petrified creature. At the end of each of its turns, the petrified creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free (and potentially falling) on a success.
>
> ***Talons.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Static Disruption (Recharge 5-6).*** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) lightning damage, and the target and any other creature within 15 ft. of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become vulnerable to lightning damage for 1 min. Any creature that fails their save can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the vulnerability on a success.

It has the same statistics as the original Halazzi and the same amount of hit points as Halazzi had remaining when the split happened. When one of the Halazzis dies, the copy or the original, the remaining Halazzi becomes the original Halazzi.
