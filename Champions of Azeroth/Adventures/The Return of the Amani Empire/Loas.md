> ***Call Lightning.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 120 ft. Hit: 14 (4d6) lightning damage, and the creature can't take reactions until the start of Akil'zon's next turn.
>
> ***Electric Storm (1/day).*** One creature within 120 ft. becomes petrified and is lifted 30 ft. straight into the air for 1 minute. At the start of each of the petrified creature's turns, it casts *call lightning* at any creature within 120 ft., that touches the ground, unless that creature is within 5 ft. of the point straight under the petrified creature. At the end of each of its turns, the petrified creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free (and potentially falling) on a success.

>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Static Disruption (Recharge 5-6).*** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) lightning damage, and the target and any other creature within 15 ft. of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become vulnerable to lightning damage for 1 min. Any creature that fails their save can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the vulnerability on a success.

When one of the Halazzis dies, the copy or the original, the remaining Halazzi becomes the original Halazzi.
