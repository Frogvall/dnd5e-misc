# Magic Items

#### Wand of Dread

*Wand, rare (requires attunement by Spellcaster)*

While holding this wand, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your spells.

When dealing damage with a spell, you can choose to replace the damage type of one or more dice into necrotic damage.

In addition, you can use this wand to cast *Create Undead*. Once you do so, you cannot use this property again until 1d6 days have passed.

#### Potion of Time Warp

*Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you enter an extradimensional space in time for up 8 hours. The space is 10 by 10 by 10 feet big, and if you leave that space the effect ends early. When the effect ends you return to where you were when you drank the potion and only a minute have passed. For anyone observing you during this minute, you appear to be sleeping.
