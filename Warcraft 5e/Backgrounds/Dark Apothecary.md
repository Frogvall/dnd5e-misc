## Dark Apothecary
The Royal Apothecary Society (or the Apothecary Society, and abbreviated R.A.S.) is an alchemical society based in the Apothecarium in Undercity. It was created by Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in order to create a new undead plague to wipe out the Scourge. Its members are all Forsaken or other types of undead beings who joined Sylvanas' cause. They are constantly brewing up new plagues and poisons to unleash upon Sylvanas' enemies. The other races of the Horde believe they are working on a remedy to cure their "illness". Members of the Apothecary society are called Apothecaries or Dark Apothecaries.

**Note:** Only the Forsaken can be members of the Royal Apothecary Society.   
##
**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana and Investigation.  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Alchemist's supplies and Poisoner's kit.  
**Equipment:** Alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kit, an armband with a flask and crown embroidered on it, a notebook, a set of black velvet robes, and a pouch containing 15 gp.
#### Feature: R.A.S. Agent
As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society, you have access to a network of supporters and operatives that are working under the official support of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. Anywhere where you can find Forsaken, you can find the Dark Apothecaries, that can support you with safe houses, assistance in finding information, herbs or alchemical ingredients. This is a two way coin, though, and they might expect you to help them with one or more tasks.
#### Suggested Characteristics
As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society you are probably curious in nature. Whether or not you're looking for a cure or a weapon you are likely to be striving for the better of the Forsaken, albeit not necessary for the Horde. Remember that "better" never means "better for everyone".
Your bond might be associated with other members of the Royal Apothecary Society, or a location or an object that is important to it. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of the Society, but might be more personal in nature.
