# Introduction
Warcraft is one of the most successful and popular fantasy video game franchises of all time. Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition is one of the most successful and popular fantasy taletop role-playing games of all time. Frankly, it's a crime that there's not an official collaboration between them! In light of this glaring absence, various creators have embarked on their own homebrew projects to bring the world of Azeroth to 5E, where as my favourite is *Champions of Azeroth* by Silverblade. The scope of the Champion series is limited however, and for us who wants to play trolls of all kind, only the Jungle Trolls and the Ice Trolls (as Frostborn Trolls in Champions of Northrend) are represented. This modules is an extension of the Champions series which brings more player options for playing Trolls.

### Design Principles
The design principles for *Champions of Azeroth* are:

- Start with D&D 5E, change things only when necessary, and add on everything else needed for a Warcraft adaptation. In practice, this generally means starting with a 5E class, add some extra Warcraft flavor and/or utility features, and write new Warcraft subclasses.
- Keep it simple. There is a tremendous amount of content in Warcraft, and you could go mad trying to do a totally faithful implementation of any Warcraft class. I tried to pick simple core fantasies and mechanics to build around, even if that means leaving a lot of inspiration unused.
- Stick to 5E design principles and mechanics. 5E does things certain ways (e.g., favoring advantage over static roll bonuses), and by now has done a lot of things in a lot of different ways. Use those principles and mechanics whenever possible, and don't go against them.
- Make sure that things using 5E vocabulary are unchanged, and things named similarly should be recognizable. Warlocks should have the same core design as 5E warlocks, mages should be based on wizards, *barkskin* is still the same terrible spell, etc. There are inevitably going to be exceptions, but they should be few and far between.
- Don't neglect utility or roleplay. Given the *Warcraft* inspiration, it can be tempting to just focus on cool combat features. But part of the joy of a 5E adaptation is getting to interact with Azeroth outside of video game fighting. I want to make sure that the design engages with the full 5E experience, not just combat.

I completely agree to the design principles of the Champions series and have done my best to adhere to them.

### On Balance
Since I am mostly dealing with subraces I am aiming for internal balance between the already existing subraces and those I add. Hence I can approach this using a limited balance scope and have no intention to benchmark these with vanilla dungeons and dragons.

### What This Is
*Champions of Azeroth* provides a plethora of new content to play 5E in Azeroth (or its various associated planes, worlds, and so on). It provides completely new *Warcraft*-inspired races and classes, as well as new equipment, feats, spells, and more. This work is meant to be an addition to the Champion series, adding player options for playing trolls or troll focused campaigns.

### Contact and Feedback
I welcome any and all feedback on any of my work. You can reach me (Auvreannia) via the the [Champions of Azeroth Discord](https://discord.gg/cRhWBfHW).

### Acknowledgements
Silverblade ([u/Silverblade1234](https://www.reddit.com/user/Silverblade1234)) for his amazing work with the whole Champion series and for many healthy discussions around game design and other things.

The [WC5E](https://www.reddit.com/r/wc5e/) project. My own *Warcraft* homebrew journey started with that project, mainly creating monsters for their monster manual, but also taking part in their 3.0 class revamp. Even though I am no longer part of that project, I have utter respect for their work.

### Troll
Once at home in the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale, the fierce trolls of the Darkspear tribe were pushed out by warring factions. Eventually the trolls befriended the orcish Horde, and Thrall, the orcs' young warchief, convinced the trolls to travel with him to Kalimdor. Though they cling to their shadowy heritage, the Darkspear trolls hold a place of honor in the Horde. Trolls are cunning, ruthless, and savage, eager to defend themselves and their allies---by any means necessary.
